# PB-apps
Fairly specialized apps for repetitive tasks here. All Pointburst things are in this folder. 


pointburstLogin: Used for monitoring our Command Center. Create a plist file to run it every 10 minutes.

jiraNewAppTemplate: This creates all the standard issues and assigns them to the right people.

socialBurst: This never really got used, but it automates sending a social burst or can be setup to send multiple bursts in a row.

appGenerator: This thing is fantastic. It basically automates the entire process--or as much as can be automated anyway. I don't know how much time this saves per app, but it's a lot. Too bad you'll probably never use it.
